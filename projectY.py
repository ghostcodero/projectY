    You are analyzing a conversation transcript. Your goal is to extract **clear, concrete predictions about the future**, 
    avoiding vague or uncertain statements.

    **What counts as a prediction?**
    - Statements that clearly express **what will happen**, **what is expected**, or **likely future outcomes**.
    - Example phrases: "will happen," "is expected to," "is likely to," "is projected to," "experts predict that," "data suggests that."

    **What to ignore?**
    - Unclear or subjective statements (e.g., "it's not over," "maybe," "we will see").
    - General reflections, opinions, or past events.

    **Transcript:**
    {transcript}

    **Task:**
    - Extract **up to 10 of the most important predictions** in a numbered list.
    - Ensure that each prediction is **specific, meaningful, and clearly about the future**.
    - If no predictions are found, respond with: "No clear predictions were made in this conversation."

    **Response Format Example:**
    1. The team is expected to switch to a defensive strategy in the next game.
    2. Analysts predict that inflation will decrease by 2% next quarter.
    3. AI adoption in healthcare will grow significantly in the next five years.
    4. The player is likely to miss the next match due to injury.
    5. Scientists anticipate a major breakthrough in battery technology by 2030.
