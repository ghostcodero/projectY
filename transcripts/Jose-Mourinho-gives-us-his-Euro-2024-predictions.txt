Jose, time for your Euro 24 predictions. Who are your winners? Portugal. Runner-up? England. Surprise package? Surprise team is anyone outside Portugal, France and England, because I think these three are the favourites. So for me, anyone that comes outside these three, even countries with statues like Germany or wherever, anyone outside these three, for me... Golden boot? Golden boot, Harry. Player of the tournament? Jude Bellingham. And last but not least, Ballon d'Or this year. Who is your favourite to win? I think Vinicius.
