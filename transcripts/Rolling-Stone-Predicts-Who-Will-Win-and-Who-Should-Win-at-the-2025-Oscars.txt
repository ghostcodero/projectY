Uh, is it me, or has it been a bit of a roller coaster in terms of the Academy Awards this year? ♪♪ My name is David Feer. I am the chief film critic and resident bespectacled nerd of Rolling Stone. I am here to talk about my predictions for the 2025 Oscars. For Best Picture, the big category, my prediction for Best Picture is a Nora. Are you serious? I am serious. Unlike last year, in which you had Oppenheimer essentially being coronated the winner of the Oscars before a single envelope had even been opened at the ceremony, there was no clear front-runner this year when the 10 nominees for Best Picture got announced. For a while, everybody thought it was gonna be The Brutalist. People were realizing that this 3 1⁄2-hour movie, this incredible throwback to these epics of yesteryear, sweeping gesture of a movie that, you know, Hollywood loves to pat itself on the back on because that's what they used to make back when Hollywood was Hollywood. And then, Amelia Perez, after The Golden Globes, had had this incredible sweep where suddenly everybody was talking once again about this musical about a transgender Mexican drug cartel kingpin. Now, obviously, as you can tell from that sentence I just said, there was also a lot of controversy about how various aspects of that got represented. It was still looking like it had a nice, good headwind going in, and then there was a scandal with some tweets, and you know the rest. That obviously gave a Nora, which was a film that people had been talking about since it had won the Palme d'Or at Cannes the previous May, and it also took the Directors Guild Association Award and the Producers Guild Association Award, and it's pretty rare that something sweeps both of those last two guild categories and doesn't go on to win Best Picture. It has happened. Look at Brokeback Mountain, but it's pretty rare, and so I think a Nora's gonna take it. There's who I think will win and who I think should win, and that happens to be the same person in this category. For Best Director, I think Brady Corbett is going to take it for The Brutalist. I just don't like being told which tools I should be pulling out of the box. I think even if the Academy does not acknowledge The Brutalist as the Best Picture of the Year, everybody's, I think they're really taken with the story of this guy who worked for seven years to get this very meager budget together and make every single cent of that count and show up on screen. Even though I know some people have a problem with the three-and-a-half-hour length, I think they are so blown away by the story behind this film, in addition to it being this old-school, sweeping Hollywood epic, that even if they don't want to reward the movie itself, they want to reward the man who made it. For Best Actor, I think it's going to be Adrian Brody for The Brutalist. Tell me, why is an accomplished foreign architect shoveling coal here in Philadelphia? I'm afraid it is not so simple. You know, it's funny. If you look at a couple of different categories this year, you're kind of seeing the OGs versus the newcomers. Best Actor's kind of a great example of this because the two top front-runners for this category right now is Adrian Brody, who had previously won for The Pianist, and Timothee Chalamet, who played Bob Dylan in A Complete Undoubt. ♪ How many roads must a man walk down? ♪ I think in this case, the OG's gonna take it. There's just something that Adrian Brody is doing in this performance that I think Academy voters are really gonna respond to and reward. Again, in the newcomers versus OGs year that we're looking at right now, this is the OG year for Best Actress, and I think Demi Moore is going to take it. I think there's a huge groundswell behind Mikey Madison this year, and rightfully so. It's an absolute great performance that she gives in Enora, and she's won a couple of major Guild Awards, not to mention the BAFTAs. First, I'm getting a lawyer. Then I'm gonna sue Yvonne and you, and I'm gonna walk away with a f***ing half because I didn't sign a prenup. It's not just that Oscars normally don't recognize horror films. It's that they normally don't recognize it in the acting categories, and what Demi Moore is doing here, in addition to the kind of comeback narrative that she's got behind her, I think is really gonna just solidify this as her year. If you had asked me to give my Oscar predictions back in January when the nominations were announced, I wouldn't have known what to say. It's been nuts to kind of see how some films have gone down and some films have gone up. It's been a real rollercoaster of a year for these Academy Awards, and frankly, I've loved taking the ride, and I'll be very happy to get off once this ride stops.
