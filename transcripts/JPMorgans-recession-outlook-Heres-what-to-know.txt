JPMorgan Chase now seeing a US or global recession before the year end as a little bit more likely than it previously did. A 35 percent chance versus a 25 percent chance previously. But still, that's a greater chance that it won't happen. The bank puts the chance of a recession before the end of next year at close to about 50-50. Joining us now is Bruce Kasman. He is JPMorgan chief economist and managing director. Bruce, great to have you on. And I hope I made that point that while you do see a slightly increased chance, I'm no math whiz, but I know that 35 percent is not a majority percent chance. Totally right. And I want to emphasize what we're arguing is that there is some signs of things happening here which are raising some concern for us, particularly as we're slowing the labor market. There's some signs that we're starting to see some job shedding behavior, some shift in business behavior, which is giving us concern. But our baseline is still to think that we make this orderly transition from an economy that was growing quite strong last year to something that's still growing at a solid pace. What I want to emphasize is there's another thing going on here, which is the risks around inflation shift as the labor market eases, as we start to see wage gains moderate, as we're seeing still strong supply side performance. So from my point of view, the modest change in recession risk is interacting with the change in inflation pressures coming from the labor market that has a much bigger effect on interest rates. And I think the big story about the last few weeks is how the interest rate outlook changes, how the Fed path changes as they have, I think, a lot of news that's going to shift them away from the gradualism they've been guiding thus far. And what would be the biggest one? Is it that we're seeing a slight uptick in unemployment rate? Is it that we're seeing a slowdown in job creation? Are you worried about U.S. household debt, $1.1 trillion in credit card debts? Bruce, if you had to pick one or two things that are kind of main on your watch list, what would it be? So I think the main thing here is business behavior. And there's a number of things that obviously influence it, including high interest rates, including the fact that we've lost some momentum in the global manufacturing sector. And the question is that we see a moderation in labor demand. That's to be expected. Over 200,000 job growth were going to be sustained. But as we downshift to that, do businesses start feeling a need to shed workers? That's where the risk to the consumer comes. That's where the risk to the broader economy comes. And again, there's some hints of that. I don't want to argue that that's been taking hold in a big way. But something has shifted here that certainly has gotten us somewhat more concerned. What would be the one thing that you would like to see? Is there anything that â€“ is it a rate cut? Is it some sort of larger quantitative back-end quantitative easing program? Is there anything the government can do to mitigate those recession chances from 35 percent back to 25 percent? Well I think there's two issues here. One is what's in the oven right now as a result of Fed policy, as a result of a whole set of things happening in the economy. These things probably can't be changed by the Fed over the next few months. So I think the first thing we want to see is some calm in terms of how the next labor market reports play out, how the consumer spending plays out, and just see that the economy is settling into something more moderate but not actually breaking. That'd be the first thing. The second thing, as I said, with some of the inflation risk profile shifting in the labor market as well, the supply side doing well, to get the Fed to move earlier and put us on a path here where we're going to have a level adjustment, I would argue, of about 100 basis points sometime in the next few months from the Fed. That changes financial market conditions. It shifts the profile on growth into next year, and it allows this moderation of growth to be more well-established at a solid pace as we look into 2025. But if we loosen financial conditions, couldn't that re-spark inflation? Sure. And that's what's been holding the Fed back right now. And I think, again, we're talking about a move from what is a restrictive policy stance to something that's less restrictive. I'm not convinced at this stage that a move from, let's say, 5.5 on the policy rate to 4.5 is going to be followed by something like a move to 3 or below, which the markets are starting to price in. But I think the argument for rebalancing risks by taking a level adjustment down, doing it earlier and not doing quite as gradually, is, I think, the big shift that's taking place here. And I think that can and probably will have a positive impact on the outlook as we look into 2025. If we're not breaking now, and of course, we come back to this original point that there's some things to be concerned about in what we see in the latest data.
