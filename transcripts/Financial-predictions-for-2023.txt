The U.S. stock market closed out 2022 with its worst year since 2008. All three major indexes all saw dips, with the Dow down nearly 9%, the S&P down over 19%, and the Nasdaq dropping more than 33% this year. The New York Stock Exchange is set to reopen for the new year on Tuesday. For more on the close of 2022 and what this means for the year ahead, let's bring in Javier David. He is the managing editor of business and markets for Axios and a CBS News contributor and always a great person for us to talk to. It's great to have you here. Happy New Year. And tell us, what are these big challenges that are facing the stock market in the new year? And do we have reason to be optimistic? Both of those scores, I'd say the biggest challenge for the market is inflation that is persistently high, uncomfortably so for the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve that is determined to reign in inflation by continuing its rate hike campaign. But all of that being said, as well as what people suspect will be a recession, which will more or less be a coin toss, at least a coin toss, but not 100%, maybe as high as 75%. So that other sort of leftover 25% sort of tail risk is what everyone is kind of hoping in. 2022 was characterized by a market that aggressively priced in recession risk, aggressively priced in more Federal Reserve rate hikes. But data suggests that whenever we have a bear market like the one we're coming out of, stocks tend to rally at least 80% of the time. So there's something to look forward to. Yeah, and less uncertainty as people maybe feel more secure in knowing that a recession is happening, even if it's a soft landing, tends to have a good effect on the markets. Javier, I want to ask you about Face the Nation. We saw Bank of America's chief economist predicting that 2023 could be a very difficult year for the economy. Let's start by playing a clip. I think we're in a situation where the risk of recession is high, may not be a deep and prolonged one, but we're in a situation where the economy has recovered very rapidly from from COVID. And it's come with a lot of inflation. And the Federal Reserve is trying to slow down the economy to bring inflation down. And in the past, more often than not, that's coincided with some sort of recession in the U.S. economy. That goes to much of what you were saying and we were discussing before. Do you think that this recession, I'm hoping to get your projections on it, how soft or hard do you think that landing is going to be and how much do you think inflation is going to come down? Yeah, I mean, that's sort of the golden question, the unanswered one. It's sort of a known unknown. What we're looking at, and bank CEOs are very useful, they tend to be very bearish. But we pay a lot of attention to what they say, primarily because they've got their fingers in a number of different pies, consumer behavior, business lending, real estate, etc. And the way that Bank of America's CEO just characterized that is accurate. It's just a Federal Reserve that is usually in rate hike mode, drives the economy lower. But what we have in our saving grace is a jobs market that continues to churn out jobs. People that want to find jobs will find jobs. That is softening the landing. What we do think will happen, what some suspect will happen is that inflation will come down, but we're not going to see 2% any time soon. And I think that that is sort of the magic number for policymakers. And even in their projections, they have anticipated higher inflation, higher rates, and that is pretty much what's going to characterize 2023. And so Javier, I know it's also kind of looking into a crystal ball, but you have all the data to make the best estimates on that. Do you think that inflation has now peaked? Well, we've had a number of head fakes, so I'm very, very deliberate in trying not to say that it's peaked, because we've had last year a lot of instances where we thought it had peaked, but it sort of came up and persisted. I do think that the worst of it is behind us, but I do believe that people, what people have to prepare themselves for is an environment where inflation is elevated. It's just we're not going to see the environment of sort of low prices, low price pressures that have characterized much of the last couple of decades. Those days are behind us, and there's no telling when we're going back to that. All right, Javier David, thank you for joining us and giving us some guidance in the storm. Thank you.
