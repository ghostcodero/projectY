      " We are now into the round of 16 of the Europa League. Let's do some predictions. Hello guys and welcome back to yet another video. As I say we are predicting the first legs of the Europa League round of 16 and this is something we haven't done much on the channel so do let me know if you like this and be sure to support the video if you want to see more Europa League predictions. Let's go for 1,100 likes. It takes two seconds to hit the like button so do be sure to drop a like and hit the subscribe button if you want to see more of this stuff. Like I say I'm happy to do more. I've really enjoyed doing the Champions League predictions so let's have a go at doing some Europa League predictions. Be sure to share your predictions down in the comments as we go along and let's get into the games and we start with AZ Alkmaar versus Tottenham Hotspur and this one could be tasty. Alkmaar did finish 19th in the Europa League League phase. They did okay. They had to go into the playoffs where they did beat Galatasaray 6-3 on aggregate. Some incredible scores there. They did score 13 goals in the league phase and conceded 13 as well and they come up against Tottenham here who did finish in fourth place in the league phase. They did do quite well to be fair scoring 19 goals in the league phase and conceding 9. Now the question marks I've got over this one is which Tottenham Hotspur are going to turn up because they can be really good, they can be really bad. It's just about what kind of consistency Andy Postakoglu can get out of them now and of course he's mentioned that he wins things in his second season so it really does feel like the Europa League is his last chance to do that. They do have a chance though and I think they could win this game. It feels like Spurs have improved a little bit recently in the Premier League. I know they lost to Manchester City last time but they have got players returning and it feels like defensively they've tightened up a little bit so I think I might go Alkmaar 0, Tottenham 1 as my prediction here which obviously would give Spurs a massive leg up and advantage going into that second leg back at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Let me know your thoughts down below, I'm just backing Spurs in that first leg. The next game then sees Stuart Bucharest taking on Lyon. Is it a difficult one to predict with the two teams not finishing that far away in the Europa League league table? Possibly. Bucharest of course finished in 11th place, they're doing well of course in the Romanian league, scored 10 goals in the league phase and conceded 9. They did get through in the playoffs winning 4-1 on aggregate and they come up against Lyon who as I say finished in 6th place scoring 16 and conceding 8 and of course have Lacazette who scored 3 goals in the Europa League so far. Once again I am struggling to predict this one, not a lot to separate the two. With Bucharest having the home advantage I might back them to get a draw but it would still be advantage to Lyon going into the second leg. I'm gonna go for a 1-1 draw as my prediction for this one. I do make Lyon the slight favourites but with the home advantage I think this could be close you know. Gonna go for a 1-1 draw. On to the next one then which sees Fenerbahce taking on Rangers. Really looking forward to this one, it's two very passionate fan bases. How will this one play out? Of course you've got Jose Mourinho in at Fenerbahce. They did finish 24th in the Europa League league table. They struggled to get through. They did have to win in the playoffs. They beat Anderlecht of course 5-2 but like I say in the league phase only scored 9 goals and conceded 11. They did not set the world on fire. As for Rangers they did well. They finished in that top 8 in 8th place scoring 16 and conceding 10. Rangers of course not going to win the Scottish Premiership this title. Celtic have pulled too far away so it really does feel like Rangers can put a lot of focus into the Europa League and look we saw them get quite far in Europe a couple years ago. Can they get as far as the final again? Maybe so long as they don't mess up in the first leg which is away from home. I think they might get a draw you know. Fenerbahce are a little bit hard to predict but in the Europa League yeah not been very consistent. I'm going to go Fenerbahce 1, Rangers 1 as my prediction which I do think is a better result for Rangers on the road and gives them a massive advantage going back to Ibrox. Let me know your thoughts Fenerbahce and Rangers fans. Next then and we go to Real Sociedad versus Manchester United. Oh is this the game of the round? It's certainly up there and Real Sociedad of course finished in 13th place. They are probably one of the favourites to go all the way in the Europa League but so are Manchester United of course and they are undefeated in the Europa League so far. In third place they finished by the way scoring 16 and conceding 9 in the league phase. Manchester United have certainly had their problems in the Premier League this season when it comes to consistency but it really does feel like they can put a lot of attention into the Europa League. I mean I don't think they're going to finish in the top seven or top eight of the Premier League. I don't think they're bad enough to get relegated so can they turn their attention to the Europa League and do they have a good chance of winning it? I think they do you know and as as weird as Manchester United can be with their consistency because they can be really good, they can be really bad, in a one-off knockout game they actually turn up sometimes and tend to do all right. So I'm going to say Real Sociedad won Manchester United 2 as my prediction. I am going to back the Red Devils to win this one and I do think they are going to be one of the favourites to go all the way. Wouldn't surprise me if Bruno Fernandes maybe gets the match winner in this one. Let me know your thoughts down below on Real Sociedad versus Manchester United. The next game then is between Ajax and Eintracht Frankfurt and once again it feels like a difficult game to predict. Ajax did finish down in 12th place in the Europa League league table which is obviously lower than Eintracht Frankfurt. They did have to get past Union Saint-Gillouis 3-2 on aggregate in the playoffs. They're obviously doing very well in the Dutch Eredivisie division and they've scored a few goals in the Europa League so far so I do think they'll score in this. Eintracht Frankfurt on the other hand finished in fifth place and they've scored a few goals themselves. They're currently third in the Bundesliga and performing quite well in general. I must admit I am tempted to go for another draw in this one but I might just back Ajax with that home advantage. I'm going to go Ajax 2, Eintracht Frankfurt 1 as my prediction here which would mean it's all to play for going back to Germany but it would give Ajax a little advantage. I think the home advantage is crucial in that one. Next then and we have Bodo Glimt versus Olympiakos. Now Bodo Glimt of course had to win in the playoffs as well after finishing ninth in the Europa League league table. They beat FC20 6-4 on aggregate. It was absolutely crazy. There was goals flying in in every direction but Olympiakos is a very difficult test for them. Olympiakos finished seventh in the Europa League league table. Now they might have only scored nine goals but they did only concede three. Very good defensively. A bit like Nottingham Forest where Maranakis also owns a club. With Olympiakos of course they've got dangerous players. El Kabi has scored quite a few goals for them this season and I think he could be pivotal in this one and if Olympiakos keep a clean sheet I think they will win this game. I'm gonna go Bodo Glimt 0 Olympiakos 2 as my prediction for that one. Let me know your thoughts down in the comments. That would give Olympiakos a massive advantage being home in the second game as well. Next then and we turn our attention to Roma versus Atletico Bilbao and once again it's very difficult to predict. I'm really not having much fun here. Roma finished in 15th place in the table. Atletico Bilbao finished in second. Inaki Williams has scored four goals in the Europa League so far and as a team they've only conceded seven. That said Roma did do well in the playoffs. They beat Porto 4-3 on aggregate and they of course have the home advantage here so I might go for another draw but I think there will be goals in this one. Both sides have scored over 14 goals collectively in the Europa League competition so far so let's go for some goals. Let's have some fun. Roma 2, Atletico Bilbao 2 is my prediction for this. Once again any draw does give the advantage to the away team going into the second leg but I wouldn't rule Roma out of winning this game but I just genuinely think the first legs can be really close and cagey and can end in draws and that's where I'm going with this one with Bilbao doing so well in the Europa League so far. Let me know your thoughts once again down in the comments. On to the final game then and we see Lazio going away to Victoria Pinson who did get through in the playoffs beating Ferencvaros 3-1 on aggregate and they did score 13 goals in the league phase conceding 12 as well but Lazio won the Europa League league phase. They came top scoring 17 only conceding five and of course they've got Pedro who scored four goals in this competition so far as well. He's going to be up there for potential top scorers come the end of this tournament. I really do fancy Lazio here I must be honest you know considering how well they did in the league phase. I'm going to back Lazio to win this one 2-1 and that like I say once again gives them a massive advantage going into that second leg. I think there'll be goals in that game so let me know your thoughts as well down in the comments. And there you have it that wraps up the predictions for the Europa League round of 16 first leg games. It's just a quick video I thought of putting out to see how you guys would like it. Let me know if you do, drop a like and subscribe if you haven't done those two things just to support the video and the channel and like I say we can meet up again for Europa League round of 16 second leg predictions next week. Thank you for your great support guys take care I'll see you in the next one. Peace out! you\n"
